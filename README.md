# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

## Description
This project processes and cleans data collected from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The steps include:

1. Merging the training and test datasets.
2. Extracting measurements of mean and standard deviation.
3. Assigning descriptive activity names.
4. Appropriately labeling the dataset with descriptive variable names.
5. Creating a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Files
- `run_analysis.R`: Script to process the data.
- `CodeBook.md`: Description of the variables and transformations.
- `tidy_data_summary.txt`: Resulting tidy dataset.

## Instructions
To reproduce the analysis, run the `run_analysis.R` script in an R environment with the necessary packages installed.
